<h1>Spencer Silva — Journalist</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>I’m a freelance writer and reporter based in Washington, D.C. </p>

<p>Over the past half-decade, I’ve covered topics of all sorts in both print and radio — from travel to housing and gentrification, to high school sports and, most recently, energy and public utilities. I also specialize in reporting with data and public records. My work has been featured in a variety of publications, not limited to, but including: the San Francisco Chronicle, the East Bay Express, Oakland Magazine, KQED and others. </p>

<p>In 2018, I earned a master’s degree from the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism.</p>
